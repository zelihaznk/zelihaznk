<h2>My name is Zeliha 👩🏻‍💻 </h2> 

<h3>About me: </h3> 
As a passionate QA Engineer, I ensure every product I test delivers both quality and reliability.
With hands-on experience in manual and automated testing, I specialize in detecting issues early, optimizing user experience, and supporting agile, high-performing teams.

I enjoy turning complex test scenarios into clear, efficient solutions — leveraging tools like Selenium, Chrome DevTools, JIRA, TestRail, Appium, PostgreSQL, and JSON.
Driven by curiosity and precision, I focus on building trust through quality in every stage of the SDLC.
